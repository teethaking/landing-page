### Commit Standards

All commits **must** follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>
```

**Types:**

| Type       | When to use                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | A new feature                                           |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                               |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes                                   |
| `style`    | Formatting, missing semicolons, etc. (not CSS changes)  |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                                |
| `chore`    | Maintenance tasks (deps, config, CI)                    |
| `perf`     | Performance improvements                                |
| `ci`       | CI/CD pipeline changes                                  |

**Examples:**

```bash
feat(waitlist): add email validation to waitlist modal
fix(navbar): resolve mobile menu focus trap
refactor(atoms): extract SectionBadge from inline JSX
docs: update README with project structure
chore: remove unused radix-ui dependencies
```

### Atomic Commits

Each commit must represent **one logical change**:

- Extracting a component AND fixing a bug = **two separate commits**
- No `WIP`, `fixup`, or `save progress` commits in your final PR
- Every commit should build and pass lint on its own
- Use `git rebase -i` to clean up your history before submitting

### Screen Recording Requirement

Every PR that includes UI changes **must** include a screen recording:

- Record a walkthrough demonstrating the feature or fix
- For bug fixes, show the before and after
- For new features, show the full user interaction
- Upload directly to the PR description or as a comment
- Accepted formats: `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.gif`, or a Loom/YouTube link

PRs with UI changes that do not include a screen recording will not be reviewed.

### Issue Labels

| Label              | Meaning                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `stellar-wave`     | Part of the open-source wave initiative   |
| `good first issue` | Great starting point for new contributors |
| `enhancement`      | New feature or improvement                |
| `bug`              | Something isn't working                   |

### PR Checklist

## Customization

### Colors

The color scheme is defined in `app/globals.css` using CSS custom properties with the OKLCH color space:

```css
.dark {
  --primary: oklch(0.65 0.25 290); /* Space purple */
  --background: oklch(0.065 0.01 290); /* Deep purple-black */
}
```

### Theme

The site supports both light and dark modes. Theme switching is handled by `next-themes`. The dark theme features a deep purple-black background with space purple accents.
